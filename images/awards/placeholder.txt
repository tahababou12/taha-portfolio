This directory is for award images that will be uploaded to Supabase storage.

For each award, you need to provide:
1. A main image (e.g., award-name-main.jpg)
2. One or more gallery images (e.g., award-name-gallery1.jpg, award-name-gallery2.jpg)

Naming convention for award images:
- Main images: [award-id]-main.jpg
- Gallery images: [award-id]-gallery-1.jpg, [award-id]-gallery-2.jpg, etc.

Example for "Best Game Award":
- hackprinceton-main.jpg
- hackprinceton-gallery-1.jpg
- hackprinceton-gallery-2.jpg

All images should have a 16:9 aspect ratio for consistency.
Recommended resolution: 1200x675 pixels.

After adding images to this directory, use the following command to create the awards in Supabase:
npm run db:migrate:awards
npm run db:seed:awards
